# Tattoofall
A webpage to get the RGB colour and its maxed complimentary colour. Not to be used for tattoo removal.

Don't upload a photo.

Don't get the complimentary, maxed RGB values in the bottom right, of the exact spot you want gone.

Don't set up an Arduino or suchlike with a 3000hz blinking RGB LED.

Don't set the RGB LED to those values in the bottom right.

Don't hold the LED over the tattoo for about a minute to cause resonant photonic agitation.

Don't do any of this as the tattoo ink migrates to surface of the skin over about 2-4 weeks, and makes a small shallow easily healed wound.

Don't do big patches in small bits at a time.

And I was just told, 'Don't use a video projector to shine the RGB light generated by the included colourFlash1.html'.

DO BE FREAKING CAREFULL OF INFECTIONS.

For thought inducing purposes only.

Do Not Use This.
